## Course overview

The purpose of Topics in Quantitative Finance is to introduce students to recent trends and advanced research topics in quantitative methods of business and finance. This year’s course is dedicated to machine learning (ML) for finance. ML has been one of the hottest technology in software engineering. This course will explore the possibility of applying ML to finance and business. The course will give students the basic ideas and intuition behind the popular ML methods and hands-on experience of using ML software package such as SK-learn and Tensorflow (Google). Each student is required to complete a final course project.

## Prerequisites

There is no formal prerequisites. However, undergraduate-level knowledge in probability/statistics and previous experience in programming language is highly recommended.
